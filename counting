Support Vector Machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. 
However, it is mostly used in classification problems. 
In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space 
(where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. 
Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well.
In general terms SVMs are very good when you have a huge number of features. 
For example for text classification in a bag of words model.
